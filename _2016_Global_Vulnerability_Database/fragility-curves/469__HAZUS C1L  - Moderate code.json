There are a large variety of frame systems. Some older concrete frames may be proportioned and detailed such that brittle failure of the frame members can occur in earthquakes leading to partial or full collapse of the buildings. Modern frames in zones of high seismicity are proportioned and detailed for ductile behavior and are likely to undergo large deformations during an earthquake without brittle failure of frame members and collapse\r\n\r\nL: Low-Rise (range between 1 -3 stories)\r\nM: Mid-Rise (range between 4 -7 stories)\r\nH: High-Rise (more than 8 stories)\r\n\r\nThe present curves represent median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves. They are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large-magnitude (i.e., M \u2245 7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km, or greater.", "geo_applicability": {"pk": 468, "model": "vulnerability.geoapplicability", "fields": {"general_information": 469, "area": "", "countries": [{"pk": "USA", "model": "vulnerability.country", "fields": {"is_visible": true, "region": 3, "name": "United States"}}], "lon": null, "address": "", "lat": null}}, "authors": "FEMA, HAZUS", "use_case_information": "", "structure_type": "Building", "taxonomy_gem": "DX+D99/CR+CT99/LFM+DU99/DY+D99/CR+CT99/LFM+DU99/HBET:1,3+HB99+HF99+HD99/Y99/OC99/BP99/PLF99/IR99/EW99/RSH99+RMT99+R99+RWC99/F99+FWC99/FOS99", "year": 2003, "type_of_assessment": "Fragility", "taxonomy_type": {"pk": 1, "model": "vulnerability.taxonomytype", "fields": {"user_def": false, "name": "GEM"}}, "taxonomy_text": "CR/LFM/HBET:1,3"}}
