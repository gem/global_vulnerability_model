Variability in base shear capacity  is obtained through pushover analyses whereas variability in demand (D) is established by employing time-history analyses. Uncertainty introduced by structural modelling (M) is assumed to be 0.3.\r\n\r\nThe fragility curve sets described above have been selected through 120 variants of fragility curve sets  generated for Turkish masonry buildings in terms of the  following major structural parameters: number of  stories, plan geometry, material quality and strength,  considerations on wall length and openings in walls.  Since the number of stories has been observed to be a very effective parameter on the seismic performance of  Turkish MUR buildings, a fragility curve set is generated  for 1,2,3,4 and 5 story buildings individually instead of  considering as low-rise or mid-rise.\r\nThe generated fragility curves are based on the in-plane shear response of the most critical story of the  building, i.e. ground story for Turkish MUR. From the generated sets of fragility curves, it is  observed that the damage state probabilities are  significantly influenced from the number of stories and wall material strength. Regularity in plan, length, and arrangement of bearing walls in plan also have  significant effect on the damage state probabilities to some extent. This shows that the inherent  characteristics of Turkish masonry buildings have been well reflected in the generated set of fragility curves.
