The roof and walls consist of lightweight panels, usually corrugated metal. The frames are designed for maximum efficiency, often with tapered beam and column sections built up of light steel plates. The frames are built in segments and assembled in the field with bolted joints. Lateral loads in the transverse direction are resisted by the rigid frames with loads distributed to them by diaphragm elements, typically rod-braced steel roof framing bays. Tension rod bracing typically resists loads in the longitudinal direction.\r\n\r\nThe present curves represent median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves. They are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large-magnitude (i.e., M \u2245 7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km, or greater.", "geo_applicability": {"pk": 447, "model": "vulnerability.geoapplicability", "fields": {"general_information": 448, "area": "", "countries": [{"pk": "USA", "model": "vulnerability.country", "fields": {"is_visible": true, "region": 3, "name": "United States"}}], "lon": null, "address": "", "lat": null}}, "authors": "FEMA, HAZUS", "use_case_information": "", "structure_type": "Building", "taxonomy_gem": "DX+D99/S+SL+SC99/LFM+DU99/DY+D99/S+SL+SC99/LFM+DU99/H99/Y99/OC99/BP99/PLF99/IR99/EW99/RSH99+RMT99+R99+RWC99/F99+FWC99/FOS99", "year": 2003, "type_of_assessment": "Fragility", "taxonomy_type": {"pk": 1, "model": "vulnerability.taxonomytype", "fields": {"user_def": false, "name": "GEM"}}, "taxonomy_text": "S+SL/LFM"}}
