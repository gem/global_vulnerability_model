In some cases, the beam-column connections have very small moment resisting capacity but, in other cases, some of the beams and columns are fully developed as moment frames to resist lateral forces. Usually the structure is concealed on the outside by exterior nonstructural walls, which can be of almost any material (curtain walls, brick masonry, or precast concrete panels), and on the inside by ceilings and column furring. Diaphragms transfer lateral loads to moment-resisting frames. The diaphragms can be almost any material. The frames develop their stiffness by full or partial moment connections. The frames can be located almost anywhere in the building. Usually the columns have their strong directions oriented so that some columns act primarily in one direction while the others act in the other direction. Steel moment frame buildings are typically more flexible than shear wall buildings. This low stiffness can result in large interstory drifts that may lead to relatively greater nonstructural damage.\r\n\r\nL: Low-Rise (range between 1 -3 stories)\r\nM: Mid-Rise (range between 4 -7 stories)\r\nH: High-Rise (more than 8 stories)\r\n\r\nThe present curves represent median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves. They are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large-magnitude (i.e., M \u2245 7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km, or greater.", "geo_applicability": {"pk": 427, "model": "vulnerability.geoapplicability", "fields": {"general_information": 428, "area": "", "countries": [{"pk": "USA", "model": "vulnerability.country", "fields": {"is_visible": true, "region": 3, "name": "United States"}}], "lon": null, "address": "", "lat": null}}, "authors": "FEMA, HAZUS", "use_case_information": "", "structure_type": "Building", "taxonomy_gem": "DX+D99/S+S99+SC99/LFM+DU99/DY+D99/S+S99+SC99/LFM+DU99/HBET:4,7+HB99+HF99+HD99/Y99/OC99/BP99/PLF99/IR99/EW99/RSH99+RMT99+R99+RWC99/F99+FWC99/FOS99", "year": 2003, "type_of_assessment": "Fragility", "taxonomy_type": {"pk": 1, "model": "vulnerability.taxonomytype", "fields": {"user_def": false, "name": "GEM"}}, "taxonomy_text": "S/LFM/HBET:4,7"}}
