The essential structural feature of these buildings is repetitive framing by wood rafters or joists on wood stud walls. Loads are light and spans are small. These buildings may have relatively heavy masonry chimneys and may be partially or fully covered with masonry veneer. Most of these buildings, especially the single-family residences, are not engineered but constructed in accordance with \u201cconventional construction\u201d provisions of building codes. Hence, they usually have the components of a lateral-force-resisting system even though it may be incomplete. Lateral loads are transferred by diaphragms to shear walls. The diaphragms are roof panels and floors that may be sheathed with sawn lumber, plywood or fiberboard sheathing. Shear walls are sheathed with boards, stucco, plaster, plywood, gypsum board, particle board, or fiberboard, or interior partition walls sheathed with plaster or gypsum board.\r\n\r\nThe present curves represent median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves. They are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large-magnitude (i.e., M \u2245 7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km, or greater.", "geo_applicability": {"pk": 414, "model": "vulnerability.geoapplicability", "fields": {"general_information": 415, "area": "", "countries": [{"pk": "USA", "model": "vulnerability.country", "fields": {"is_visible": true, "region": 3, "name": "United States"}}], "lon": null, "address": "", "lat": null}}, "authors": "FEMA, HAZUS", "use_case_information": "", "structure_type": "Building", "taxonomy_gem": "DX+D99/W+WLI/LWAL+DU99/DY+D99/W+WLI/LWAL+DU99/HBET:1,2+HB99+HF99+HD99/Y99/OC99/BP99/PLF99/IR99/EW99/RSH99+RMT99+R99+RWC99/F99+FWC99/FOS99", "year": 2003, "type_of_assessment": "Fragility", "taxonomy_type": {"pk": 1, "model": "vulnerability.taxonomytype", "fields": {"user_def": false, "name": "GEM"}}, "taxonomy_text": "W+WLI/LWAL/HBET:1,2"}}
