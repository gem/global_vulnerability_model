In buildings built before 1900, the majority of floor and roof construction consists of wood sheathing supported by wood framing. In large multistory buildings, the floors are cast-in-place concrete supported by the unreinforced masonry walls and/or steel or concrete interior framing. In unreinforced masonry constructed after 1950 (outside California) wood floors usually have plywood rather than board sheathing. In regions of lower seismicity, buildings of this type constructed more recently can include floor and roof framing that consists of metal deck and concrete fill supported by steel framing elements. The perimeter walls, and possibly some interior walls, are unreinforced masonry. The walls may or may not be anchored to the diaphragms. Ties between the walls and diaphragms are more common for the bearing walls than for walls that are parallel to the floor framing. Roof ties usually are less common and more erratically spaced than those at the floor levels. Interior partitions that interconnect the floors and roof can reduce diaphragm displacements.\r\n\r\nL: Low-Rise (range between 1 -2  stories)\r\nM: Mid-Rise (more than 3 stories)\r\n\r\nThe present curves represent median values of equivalent-PGA fragility curves. They are based on median values of spectral displacement of the damage state of interest and an assumed demand spectrum shape that relates spectral response to PGA. As such, median values of equivalent PGA are very sensitive to the shape assumed for the demand spectrum. The reference spectrum represents ground shaking of a large-magnitude (i.e., M \u2245 7.0) western United States (WUS) earthquake for soil sites (e.g., Site Class D) at site-to-source distances of 15 km, or greater.", "geo_applicability": {"pk": 535, "model": "vulnerability.geoapplicability", "fields": {"general_information": 536, "area": "", "countries": [{"pk": "USA", "model": "vulnerability.country", "fields": {"is_visible": true, "region": 3, "name": "United States"}}], "lon": null, "address": "", "lat": null}}, "authors": "FEMA, HAZUS", "use_case_information": "", "structure_type": "Building", "taxonomy_gem": "DX+D99/MUR+MUN99+MO99/LWAL+DU99/DY+D99/MUR+MUN99+MO99/LWAL+DU99/HBET:3,5+HB99+HF99+HD99/Y99/OC99/BP99/PLF99/IR99/EW99/RSH99+RMT99+R99+RWC99/F99+FWC99/FOS99", "year": 2003, "type_of_assessment": "Fragility", "taxonomy_type": {"pk": 1, "model": "vulnerability.taxonomytype", "fields": {"user_def": false, "name": "GEM"}}, "taxonomy_text": "MUR/LWAL/HBET:3,5"}}
