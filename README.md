## What can I find in this repository?

Inside each country's directory one can find a total of five files listed below

- taxonomy_mapping_*.csv : This file has the complete list of building classes used in the exposure model and their match in the vulnerability model with the respective weight used by the [OpenQuake-engine](https://github.com/gem/oq-engine). If a specific mapping file exists for the country then that file should be used in calculations, if such file does not exist a regional mapping is provided in the directory.  
- vulnerability_structural.xml : This file contains the vulnerability functions for structural elements used by OpenQuake-engine to compute economic losses.
- vulnerability_nostructural.xml : This file contains the vulnerability functions for non-structural elements (drift and acceleration sensitive elements) used by OpenQuake-engine to compute economic losses.
- vulnerability_contents.xml : This file contains the vulnerability functions for contents used by OpenQuake-engine to compute economic losses.
- vulnerability_fatalities.xml : This file contains the vulnerability functions for occupants used by OpenQuake-engine to compute the number human casualties. 

## How were the models developed?

A complete description of the vulnerability modelling workflow is provided in the [documentation page](https://docs.openquake.org/vulnerability/). The models were developed using the Vulnerability Modellers Toolkit (VMTK) ([Martins et al 2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10518-021-01187-w)), a suite of tools developed by scientists working at the Global Earthquake Model Foundation and intended to provide earthquake engineers with a comprehensive platform to develop fragility and vulnerability models. The toolkit is freely accessible through its [github repository](https://github.com/GEMScienceTools/VMTK-Vulnerability-Modellers-ToolKit). A demonstration of the capabilities of the VMTK can be found [here](https://www.globalquakemodel.org/vmtk-webinar-2023)      

## Where can I find additional information on the defined building classes?

The building classes defined within this exposure model follow the [GEM Building Taxonomy v3.2 convention](https://github.com/gem/gem_taxonomy). Please refer to the [GEM Taxonomy Glossary](https://taxonomy.openquake.org/) for additional details on taxonomy substrings.

# ü§î Frequently asked questions 

### Which version am I seeing? How to change the version?
By default you will see the files in the repository in the  `main` branch. Each version of the model that is released can be accessed is marked with a `tag`. By changing the tag version at the top of the repository, you can change see the files for a given version.

Note that the `main` branch could contain the work-in-progress of the next version of the model.

### How do I download the data for a given version?
For each version, a related zip file is available in the [release section](https://github.com/gem/global_vulnerability_model/releases).

### Where can I obtain the fragility functions or obtain vulnerability models for other risk metrics such as business interruption?

Please contact us at product@globalquakemodel.org

### What if my use case does not comply with the Creative Commons license offered?

If your use case deviates from the requirements of the offered license, but still want to explore the use of the data, please contact us at license@globalquakemodel.org
