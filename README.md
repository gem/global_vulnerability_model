## What can I find in this repository?

Inside each country's directory one can find a total of five files listed below

- taxonomy_mapping_*.csv : This file has the complete list of building classes used in the exposure model and their match in the vulnerability model with the respesctive weight used by the OpenQuake-engine. If a specific mapping file exists for the country then that file should be used in calculations, if such file does not exist a regional mapping is provided in the directory.  
- vulnerability_structural.xml : This file contains the vulnerability functions for structural elements used by OpenQuake-engine to compute economic losses.
- vulnerability_nostructural.xml : This file contains the vulnerability functions for non-structural elements (drift and acceleration sensitive elements) used by OpenQuake-engine to compute economic losses.
- vulnerability_contents.xml : This file contains the vulnerability functions for contents used by OpenQuake-engine to compute economic losses.
- vulnerability_fatalities.xml : This file contains the vulnerability functions for occupants used by OpenQuake-engine to compute the number human casualties. 

## Where can I find additional information on the defined building classes?

The building classes defined within this exposure model follow the GEM Taxonomy convention. Please refer to the [GEM Taxonomy Glossary](https://taxonomy.openquake.org/) for additional details on taxonomy substrings.

# ü§î Frequently asked questions 

### Which version am I seeing? How to change the version?
By default you will see the files in the repository in the  `main` branch. Each version of the model that is released can be accessed is marked with a `tag`. By changing the tag version at the top of the repository, you can change see the files for a given version.

Note that the `main` branch could contain the work-in-progress of the next version of the model.

### How do I download the data for a given version?
For each version, a related zip file is available in the [release section](https://github.com/gem/global_exposure_model/releases).

### Where can I find the models at the highest available resolution?
