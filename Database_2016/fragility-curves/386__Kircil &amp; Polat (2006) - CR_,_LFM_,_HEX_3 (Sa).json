The presented fragility curves are the combination of the two materials (the user can refer to the publication for the curves with different reinforcement steel strength). In addition curves for building with 4 and 6 storeys were generated using interpolation among the other curves.\r\n\r\nThe structural period was taken as the average value between X and Y direction.", "geo_applicability": {"pk": 385, "model": "vulnerability.geoapplicability", "fields": {"general_information": 386, "area": "Istanbul", "countries": [{"pk": "TUR", "model": "vulnerability.country", "fields": {"is_visible": true, "region": 6, "name": "Turkey"}}], "lon": null, "address": "", "lat": null}}, "authors": "M.
